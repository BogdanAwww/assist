		question: 'Why do I need to register for Assist.?',
		answer: 'You need to register in order to be displayed in the niche search for performers and always be available to producers and other customers. If you publish a portfolio on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and other platforms, it reaches the end consumer, in most cases, only by sending a direct link. Once the portfolio is filled in Assist., It remains available to customers always and at any time. Remember that you can be found on the platform through a search or invited to a project. We also offer registered performers to our Premium clients.'
	},
	{
		question: "Why can't I see any projects?",
		answer: `There are several reasons why you do not see any projects:
1) The customer has already selected a specialist and completed the project, which made him inactive and unavailable for viewing.
2) The search term for specialists has expired.
On average, the search is open from 3 to 7 days. This term is determined by the customer himself. After the search term expires, the project becomes inactive.
3) Your profile contains a specialty that does not fit the project.
If the customer is looking for an operator, and your profile indicates the specialty of operator-director, the system will not match your interests and you will not see the project.
Your profile contains a geolocation that does not fit the project.
As in point 3, if the customer is looking for an operator from Krasnodar, and Moscow is indicated in your geolocation, the system will not correlate your data and you will not see the project.

Despite the fact that at the moment there is no project for your specialty, we can still be useful to you.

- Design your profile and portfolio. This will increase your chances of being invited to the project, as well as provide an opportunity to receive a cash prize, which we give away every three months among users for the best portfolio. In addition, some Customers are looking for Contractors without publishing a project, by means of a search.
- See what others are doing. Browse the work of colleagues and get inspired. Ask questions and find a mentor.
- Find like-minded people. We all have projects and ideas that we have long wanted to work on and bring to life! So why sit still? Gather a team on a platform for a non-profit project, remove a pilot - and you will have every chance of getting funding! We will also support you in this project.
